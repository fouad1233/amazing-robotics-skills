# Joint Agent Validation

Run the two optional static validation gates against a Joint Agent output and
preserve their raw reports. These checks help users understand whether a 0.5
Research Preview package is ready for a particular simulation workflow.

## When to Use

- Use when the user asks to validate a Joint Agent `.usd`, `.usda`, `.usdc`, or
  `.usdz` output.
- Use when the user mentions Gate 3A, Isaac Sim Asset Validator, Gate 3B,
  SimReady Foundation, SimReady readiness, or physics-schema findings.
- Use after Joint Agent has produced a final package. Do not validate a
  temporary staging layer when a published USDZ exists.
- Use `validation-agent-cli` for render, visual, prompt-match, or behavior
  validation that is outside the Gate 3A/3B static profiles.

## Limitations

- Joint Agent 0.5 is a Research Preview. A package can open and match the
  accepted joint graph while still failing these validation profiles.
- Gate 3A requires a compatible Isaac Sim Python runtime containing
  `omni.asset_validator.core` and `isaacsim.asset.validation`. This skill does
  not download Isaac Sim or accept its EULA for the user.
- Gate 3B may clone the public SimReady Foundation repository and create a
  managed validation environment when dependencies are missing.
- Neither gate repairs the USD. Preserve findings and route fixes back to the
  appropriate authoring workflow.
- Gate 3A and Gate 3B are static checks. They do not run dynamic simulation or
  prove contact behavior, joint motion, containment, or long-run stability.
- Gate 3A hashes all bytes in a USDZ archive before and after validation. For a
  loose USD layer, the hash covers only the root layer, so that evidence is
  diagnostic-only when external dependencies exist.
- Missing runtime dependencies are `BLOCKED`, not validation failures.
- By default, completed validation with profile findings exits successfully so
  an agent can collect the report. Add `--strict` when findings must fail the
  shell command.

## Prerequisites

Run from the repository root and activate the project environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e . -e apps/joint_agent \
  -e agentic/packages/content_agent_workflows
```

For Gate 3A, locate the Python launcher for an installed Isaac Sim runtime.
Review and accept the applicable Isaac Sim license terms before setting the
EULA variable:

```bash
export ISAAC_SIM_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/isaac-sim/python.sh
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES
```

The 0.5 validation baseline is Linux with GLIBC 2.35 or newer, Python 3.12,
and Isaac Sim `6.0.0.1`. If a compatible runtime is not already installed,
create an isolated environment only after reviewing its license terms:

```bash
ISAAC_VENV="$HOME/.cache/content-agents/isaacsim-validator-6.0"
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed "$ISAAC_VENV"
"$ISAAC_VENV/bin/python" -m pip install \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com \
  'isaacsim[all,extscache]==6.0.0.1'
export ISAAC_SIM_PYTHON="$ISAAC_VENV/bin/python"
```

Do not print credentials or license tokens. Gate 3A and Gate 3B do not require
VLM API keys.

## Instructions

1. Resolve the final Joint Agent USD-family output to an absolute path.
2. Create a new validation output directory. Gate 3A reports are create-only;
   choose a fresh path and do not mix reports from different package identities.
3. Run Gate 3A when an Isaac Sim runtime is available. If it is unavailable,
   preserve the generated `blocked` report and continue with Gate 3B.
4. Run the SimReady Foundation preflight, then Gate 3B with the explicit
   `Prop-Robotics-Isaac@1.0.0` profile.
5. Read each JSON report. Distinguish `fail` from `blocked` or `error`.
6. Return the package path, both statuses, top hard findings, and report paths.
7. Do not describe the package as simulation-ready unless the requested
   profiles pass and the intended runtime behavior is separately verified.

## Gate 3A

Run the bundled diagnostic runner through the Isaac Sim Python launcher:

```bash
mkdir -p ./joint-validation

"$ISAAC_SIM_PYTHON" \
  .agents/skills/joint-agent-validation/scripts/run_gate3a.py \
  /absolute/path/to/joint-output.usdz \
  --report ./joint-validation/gate3a.json
```

Use `--strict` only when `fail` or `warning` must produce a non-zero exit code:

```bash
"$ISAAC_SIM_PYTHON" \
  .agents/skills/joint-agent-validation/scripts/run_gate3a.py \
  /absolute/path/to/joint-output.usdz \
  --report ./joint-validation/gate3a.json \
  --strict
```

The runner uses the `articulated-prop-v1` profile. It enables the installed
Basic, schema, geometry, material, layout, skeleton, USD Physics, Omni
SimReady, Isaac physics, and Isaac SimReady rule categories while excluding
robot-only packaging rules.

## Gate 3B

Preflight the managed Foundation runtime:

```bash
content-workflow-simready-preflight
```

Run the explicit Isaac-oriented prop profile. USDZ inputs are safely staged for
the upstream validator without changing the published package:

```bash
content-workflow-simready-validate-profile \
  /absolute/path/to/joint-output.usdz \
  --profile Prop-Robotics-Isaac \
  --profile-version 1.0.0 \
  --report ./joint-validation/gate3b.json \
  --stdout-log ./joint-validation/gate3b.stdout.log \
  --stderr-log ./joint-validation/gate3b.stderr.log
```

Add `--no-install-missing` for an offline check-only preflight or `--strict`
when profile findings must fail the shell command.

## Output Format

Return a concise result with:

- absolute input package path;
- input SHA-256 and its before/after identity check;
- Gate 3A status and `gate3a.json` path;
- Gate 3B status and normalized/raw report paths;
- hard finding counts grouped by rule or requirement;
- any `BLOCKED` runtime prerequisite and the exact next step;
- a clear statement that validation ran without modifying the package.

Interpret statuses as follows:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pass` / `PASS` | The selected static profile reported no blocking findings. |
| `warning` / `WARN` | Validation completed with warnings. |
| `fail` / `FAIL` | Validation completed and found profile violations. |
| `blocked` / `BLOCKED` | A runtime, extension, profile, or dependency was unavailable. |
| `error` / `ERROR` | The validator could not complete reliably. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 3A reports `blocked` before Kit starts | Isaac Sim Python or EULA acceptance is missing. | Set `ISAAC_SIM_PYTHON`, review the license, set `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES`, and rerun. |
| Gate 3A lists missing categories | The Isaac Sim runtime does not contain the required validator extensions/rules. | Use a complete compatible Isaac Sim installation. Do not treat a partial category run as Gate 3A. |
| Gate 3A reports joint state, drive, rigid-body, collider, mass, or articulation-root failures | The Research Preview output lacks complete simulation schemas. | Preserve the raw findings and report the 0.5 limitation; do not silently add guessed physics. |
| Gate 3B is `BLOCKED` | Foundation specs or the validator environment are unavailable. | Rerun preflight with network access, or pass `--foundation-root` and `--venv`. |
| Gate 3B rejects an existing staging workspace | A prior deterministic USDZ staging path remains. | Choose a fresh report path/output directory and rerun. |
| A gate fails but the USDZ opens | Package integrity and simulation readiness are separate contracts. | Report both facts without converting one into the other. |
